== Torus SPEC (0.0.3)

(Shamelessly cribbing from the Ring Spec since 2011.)

Torus is definied in terms of handlers, middleware, request maps, and response
maps.


== Handlers

Handlers are Clojurescript functions that take a request map and return a
response map. Handlers should be referentially transparent.


== Middleware

Higher order functions that take one or more handlers and configuration options
and return a new handler with the desired compound behaviour.


== Request Map

A Clojurescript map with the following keys:

:location
  (Required, IPersistentMap)
  A map that always contains the following keys (from js/location):

  :hash
    (String)
    URL hash tag.

  :host
    (String)
    Server hostname and port.

  :hostname
    (String)
    Server domain name or IP address.

  :href
    (String)
    Complete URL.

  :origin
    (String)
    Server protocol and host.

  :pathname
    (String)
    Everything between the :origin and :hash.

  :port
    (Integer)
    Server port number.

  :protocol
    (Keyword)
    :https or :http

:history-state (optional)
  (Optional, Object)
  The state object from js/history.


== Response Map

A Clojurescript map. The keys of the map are processed in the order they
apper below.

:id
  (Optional, String)
  The response id. Used to determine whether to process the response.  The
  previous response id is stored at the root element (html) in the attribute
  defined by the :torus-response-id option to me.panzoo.torus/init. This
  attribute is checked before the rest of the response is processed. If the
  attribute is equal to the response id, nothing futher is done.

:head
  (Optional, () -> ISeq)
  A thunk returning a sequence of DOM nodes. These nodes are appended
  to the document head and the class defined by the :torus-class option to
  me.panzoo.torus/init is added to them. Before this happens the previous
  children of head which have that class are removed.

:body
  (Required, () -> HTMLBodyElement)
  A thunk returning a body node. Used to replace the document body.

:title
  (Required, String)
  The new document title.

:replace-id
  (Optional, IPersistentMap)
  A map of String keys to thunks returning DOM node values. For each key-value
  pair, the DOM node whose id matches the key is replaced with the value node,
  whose id is then changed to match they key.
